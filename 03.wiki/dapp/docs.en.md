#### What is a DAPP?

For an application to be considered a Dapp (pronounced Dee-app, similar to Email) it must meet the following criteria:

* The application must be completely open-source, it must operate autonomously, and with no entity controlling the majority of its tokens. The application may adapt its protocol in response to proposed improvements and market feedback but all changes must be decided by consensus of its users.

* The application's data and records of operation must be cryptographically stored in a public, decentralized blockchain in order to avoid any central points of failure.

* The application must use a cryptographic token (bitcoin or a token native to its system) which is necessary for access to the application and any contribution of value from (miners / farmers) should be rewarded in the application’s tokens.

* The application must generate tokens according to a standard crytptographic algorithm acting as a proof of the value nodes are contributing to the application ([Bitcoin](../bitcoin) uses the Proof of Work Algorithm).

Decentralized applications were initially described as Decentralized Autonomous Corporations, DAC, in an article written by Daniel Larimer, of [Invictus Innovations](http://bitsharesblog.com/tag/invictus-innovations/).

#### Classification of Dapps

There are several characteristics according to which decentralized applications can be classified. For the purposes of this paper, we will classify Dapps based on whether they have their own block chain or they use the block chain of another Dapp. Based on this criterion, there are three types of Dapps.

**Type I** decentralized applications have their own block chain. [Bitcoin](../bitcoin) is the most famous example of a type I decentralized application but Litecoin and other “alt-coins” are of the same type.

**Type II** decentralized applications use the block chain of a type I decentralized application. Type II decentralized applications are protocols and have tokens that are necessary for their function. The [Omni Protocol](http://www.omnilayer.org/) is an example of a type II decentralized application.

**Type III** decentralized applications use the protocol of a type II decentralized application. Type III decentralized applications are protocols and have tokens that are necessary for their function. For example the [SAFE Network](https://safenetwork.org/) that uses the [Omni Protocol](http://www.omnilayer.org/) to issue ‘safecoins’ that can be used to acquire distributed file storage is an example of a type III decentralized application.

A useful analogy for a type I Dapp is a computer operating system (like Windows, Mac OS X, Linux, Android, iOS) for a type II Dapp a general purpose software program (like a word processor, a spreadsheet software, a file synchronization system such as Dropbox) and for type III Dapp, a specialized software solution (like a mail-merge tool that uses a word processor, an expense report macro that uses a spreadsheet, or a blogging platform that uses Dropbox.) Using this analogy, it may be expected that due to network effects and the ecosystem surrounding each decentralized application, there will be a few type I Dapps, more type II Dapps and even more type III Dapps.

At this point, it is important to mention that there are currently several excellent open-source projects that leverage type I Dapps. Colored coins and CoinJoin, for example, are based on the Bitcoin block chain and provide useful features to their users. These projects however cannot be classified as type II Dapps, according to our definition, because they don’t issue and manage a token. (The development and operation of these projects depends on donations instead.)
