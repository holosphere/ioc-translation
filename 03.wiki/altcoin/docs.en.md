Altcoins are alternative cryptocurrencies launched after the success of [Bitcoin](../bitcoin). Generally, they project themselves as better substitutes to other cryptocurrencies or [Bitcoin](../bitcoin). Many altcoins are trying to target any perceived limitations that [Bitcoin](../bitcoin) has and come up with competitive advantages. There is a great variety of altcoins, and you can find a list of them on websites such as [coinmarketcap.com](https://coinmarketcap.com) or [altcoins.com](http://altcoins.com/).

"Altcoin" is a combination of two words: "alt" and "coin"; alt is short for alternative and coin signifies currency. Thus together they imply a category of cryptocurrency that is alternative to the digital currency [Bitcoin](../bitcoin). After the success story of [Bitcoin](../bitcoin), many other peer-to-peer digital currencies have emerged in an attempt to imitate that success.

One of the goals of the [Internet of Coins](internetofcoins.org) project is to preserve usability of the altoins by enabling them to be hooked into a decentralized financial web.
