A blockchain is a public ledger of transactions that have been executed on a decentralized network. The first working example of a blockchain is [Bitcoin](../bitcoin). It is constantly growing as ‘completed’ blocks are added to it with a new set of recordings. The blocks are added to the blockchain in a linear, chronological order. Each node (computer connected to the [Bitcoin](../bitcoin) network using a client that performs the task of validating and relaying transactions) gets a copy of the blockchain, which gets downloaded automatically upon joining the [Bitcoin](../bitcoin) network. The blockchain has complete information about the addresses and their balances right from the genesis block to the most recently completed block.

To use conventional banking as an analogy, the blockchain is like a full history of banking transactions. [Bitcoin](../bitcoin) transactions are entered chronologically in a blockchain just the way bank transactions are. Blocks, meanwhile, are like individual bank statements.

Based on the [Bitcoin](../bitcoin) protocol, the blockchain database is shared by all nodes participating in a system. The full copy of the blockchain has records of every [Bitcoin](../bitcoin) transaction ever executed. It can thus provide insight about facts like how much value belonged a particular address at any point in the past.

The ever-growing size of the blockchain is considered by some to be a problem due to issues like storage and synchronization. For [Bitcoin](../bitcoin), on average, every 10 minutes, a new block is appended to the block chain through mining. For [altcoins](../altcoins) blocks are often appended with even shorter time intervals, thus sometimes increasing blockchain size faster.

To avoid the problems induced with an ever growing blockchain, the Internet of Coins project uses a [weavechain](../weavechain) instead of a blockchain to store transaction related data.
