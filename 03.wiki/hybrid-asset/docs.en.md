We define a hybrid asset as a blockchain-agnostic set of tokens allocated on multiple digital value exchanges or multiple blockchains. The Internet of Coins node daemon <a href="../hybridd">hybridd</a> ’glues’ crypto-assets and coins together by passing around datasets over the <a href="../weavechain">weavechain</a> that contains identification information about each invidual blockchain-based asset, and rulesets that govern their relationship to form a hybrid asset. This allows for the creation of assets that have the flexibility to pass their value from blockchain to blockchain, or system to system.
