A weavechain is the decentralized storage system for [Internet of Coins](internetofcoins.org) containing a sequence of interwoven block streams that can store different types of data. It is a priority-based data retention system which stores cryptographically secured blocks on a decentralized network of computers.

Like a [blockchain](../blockchain), a weavechain can function as a public ledger of transactions that have been executed on a decentralized network. The first working example of a blockchain is [Bitcoin](../bitcoin), however, its constantly growing chain size has been percieved by some as a problem that grows more urgent over time.

As ‘completed’ blocks are added to a weavechain block strand, data is retained based on the capacity of the machine the weavechain is running on. Certain strands that have lower priority may be dropped to conserve storage space. When needed, this data can be pulled from machines that have more storage space for all priority strands.

Blocks are added to the weavechain strands in parallel. Every strand records blocks in a linear, chronological order.
