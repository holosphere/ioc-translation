A cryptocurrency (or crypto currency) is a digital asset designed to work as a medium of exchange using cryptography to secure the transactions and to control the creation of additional units of the currency. Cryptocurrencies are a subset of alternative currencies, or specifically of digital currencies.

[Bitcoin](../bitcoin) became the first decentralized cryptocurrency in 2009. Since then, numerous cryptocurrencies have been created. These are frequently called [altcoins](../altcoin), as a blend of bitcoin alternative. [Bitcoin](../bitcoin) and its derivatives use decentralized control as opposed to centralized electronic money/centralized banking systems. The decentralized control is related to the use of bitcoin's blockchain transaction database in the role of a distributed ledger.
