## Why
### The blockchain was conceived for financial liberty

<span class="column-left">
The present cryptocurrency scene is fragmented and potentially at risk of becoming financially and politically centralized. Like ourselves, many blockchain enthusiasts would not want this to happen.<br><br>Powerful financial actors often merely want to reap rewards by doing business in the cryptocurrency scene. Although we believe this to be an inevitable development, we are also convinced that this must not pose a negative influence on the fundamental liberties of users and developers of cryptocurrencies.

<b>We want to enable the free and unlimited exchange of value among crypto-ledger based systems and other financial systems.</b><br><br>Our vision for the Internet of Coins is an inclusive autonomous network, enabling anyone to participate and build alternative financial instruments and markets, featuring equality in participation, representation and influence.<br><br>Where peer-to-peer cooperation is rewarded and encouraged by way of incentives through open standards, aiming for inter-systemic equilibrium and freedom.

<br><br>

<span class="column-center">We believe that building yet another system-to-rule-them-all does not represent a way forward. Instead, in our opinion, the best way to ensure freedom and justice for all is to integrate existing and future crypto-technologies into an independent, loosely coupled and autonomous ecosystem.<br><br><b>That is why we designed Internet of Coins to support all cryptocurrencies.</b></span>
