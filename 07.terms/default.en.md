#### Accountability
<span class="column-left" style="width: 200px;"><br>![NLnet](nlnet.png)</span><span class="column-right">Internet of Coins is held accountable to how collected funds are being spent by the appointed sequestration organization, the <a href="https://nlnet.nl" target="_blank">NLnet Foundation</a>. Every payment, whether regular or bounty, must be requested before funds can be spent, to safeguard the financial situation of Internet of Coins, and to make sure developments can proceed in a steady and orderly fashion. In this way all funds vested by crowdfunding participants are legally and procedurally safeguarded. Read more <a href="https://coinstorm.net/terms/NLnet_letter.pdf">here</a>.</span>

<br><br>
The project manager of the Internet of Coins team, along with the board of recommendation, will keep track of the advances in development, marketing and all other details regarding the project and its timeline. Updates will be sent out in the form of newsletters to cover unfolding events and milestones reached. Every quarter the developments done will be assessed and planning for the following quarter will be adjusted where necessary to enable a timely response to technological progress outside the project as well as what is happening in the cryptocurrency markets. 
<br><br>
#### Tokens
The tokens distributed for the Internet of Coins project are called HYBRID. These tokens will be made available initially on seven different blockchain ecosystems simultaneously, namely <a href="https://bitcoin.com" target="_blank">Bitcoin</a> (BTC), <a href="https://ethereum.org" target="_blank">Ethereum</a> (ETH), <a href="https://counterparty.io" target="_blank">CounterParty</a> (XCP), <a href="http://nxt.org/" target="_blank">NXT Platform</a> (NXT), <a href="https://www.nem.io/" target="_blank">New Economy Movement</a> (XEM), <a href="https://wavesplatform.com/" target="_blank">Waves Platform</a> (WAVES) and <a href="https://bitshares.org/" target="_blank">Bitshares</a> (BTS).
There will be 1000000 (one million) tokens available on each ecosystem. During the crowdfund 900000 (nine hundred thousand) of these tokens will be offered to those taking part. 100000 (one hundred thousand) tokens will be reserved for crowdfund reward payouts.
<span class="column-left"><br>During the crowdfund the price per HYBRID token will increase over time. Once the fundraiser is over, tokens will not be subject to inflation other than the moments that HYBRID is expanded to new blockchains.<br><br>Furthermore, as long as the project has the ability to proceed as planned, crowdfund token holders will receive rewards in the three years following the fundraiser. These will be distributed as follows:<small><br>
in 2018 5% of remaining 10% reserved tokens,<br>
in 2019 3% of remaining 10% reserved tokens,<br>
in 2020 2% of remaining 10% reserved tokens,<br></small>
