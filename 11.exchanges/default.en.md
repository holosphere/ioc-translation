## Exchanges
<h3>"When the wind of change blows, some build walls while others build windmills."<br><span style="color:gray;"> -- English saying</span></h3>

#### Where to exchange HYBRID
As the Internet of Coins wallet is released in the course of 2018, everyone will be able to use and manage their tokens with a user-friendly app on our network. <br>Distribution of the tokens will then commence and we will contact everyone that participated in our crowdfund. There are already some exchanges online where HYBRID can be swapped for other cryptocurrencies. We are currently compiling a list and are contacting these exchanges to get HYBRID listed. As we go along these exchanges will be listed here.

<br><br>
#### Recognizing the real token
HYBRID has been launched on seven blockchain systems. Most of these have their own decentralized exchanges. On these exchanges random tokens are sometimes launched by individuals trying to masquerade as legitimate projects. To make sure you can recognize and verify the real HYBRID token for exchanging we list a few details below for each decentralized exchange.

This is the decentralized world.<br>
Nobody can help you if you lose your keys.<br>
We do NOT advise to use centralized exchange 'wallets'.<br>
This will pose a risk to your funds like what happened to Cryptsy.
