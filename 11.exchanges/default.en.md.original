## Terms
<h3>"The palest ink is better than the best memory."<br><span style="color:gray;"> -- Chinese proverb</span></h3>
#### Overview
These terms outline the details on how funds raised by the Internet of Coins project will be used, and to which rules the fundraiser as well as its participants are bound. Every effort has been made to spell out a clear and transparent summary of what is contained in the legal terms. If you have any questions, do not hesitate to contact the Internet of Coins team using the contact form on the home page. This summary may be subject to change. The legal terms can be found below.
<br><br>
#### Accountability
<span class="column-left" style="width: 200px;"><br>![NLnet](nlnet.png)</span><span class="column-right">Internet of Coins is held accountable to how collected funds are being spent by the appointed sequestration organization, the <a href="https://nlnet.nl" target="_blank">NLnet Foundation</a>. Every payment, whether regular or bounty, must be requested before funds can be spent, to safeguard the financial situation of Internet of Coins, and to make sure developments can proceed in a steady and orderly fashion. In this way all funds vested by crowdfunding participants are legally and procedurally safeguarded. Read more <a href="https://coinstorm.net/terms/NLnet_letter.pdf">here</a>.</span>

<br><br>
The project manager of the Internet of Coins team, along with the board of recommendation, will keep track of the advances in development, marketing and all other details regarding the project and its timeline. Updates will be sent out in the form of newsletters to cover unfolding events and milestones reached. Every quarter the developments done will be assessed and planning for the following quarter will be adjusted where necessary to enable a timely response to technological progress outside the project as well as what is happening in the cryptocurrency markets. 
<br><br>
#### Tokens
The tokens distributed for the Internet of Coins project are called HYBRID. These tokens will be made available initially on seven different blockchain ecosystems simultaneously, namely <a href="https://bitcoin.com" target="_blank">Bitcoin</a> (BTC), <a href="https://ethereum.org" target="_blank">Ethereum</a> (ETH), <a href="https://counterparty.io" target="_blank">CounterParty</a> (XCP), <a href="http://nxt.org/" target="_blank">NXT Platform</a> (NXT), <a href="https://www.nem.io/" target="_blank">New Economy Movement</a> (XEM), <a href="https://wavesplatform.com/" target="_blank">Waves Platform</a> (WAVES) and <a href="https://bitshares.org/" target="_blank">Bitshares</a> (BTS).
