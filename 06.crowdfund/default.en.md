## Crowdfund statistics
<h3>"A dwarf is small even if he stands on a mountain;<br>a colossus keeps his height, even if he stands in a well."<br><span style="color:gray;"> -- Lucius Annaeus Seneca</span></h3>
#### Status
Our crowdfund was a success!
<br><br>
![](raised_amount.png?resize=60%)
<br><br>
We managed to exceed our initial target by far, and that without the help of any venture<br>capitalist funding! Only the power of the crowd. We are thankful for all the support you<br>have given us, and are now working hard to build the Internet of Coins.
<br>

##### Amount of HYBRID issued: <big>900,000+</big><br>
Distribution of the tokens will take place after July 1st, and we are working hard to launch this<br>multi-chain token technology to an exchange. Trading of HYBRID will first be segmented, until the<br>technology to fuse the individual units together has been implemented. Please trade with caution!
